Rural Health AI Assistant! This tool is designed to support healthcare workers in remote and rural areas by providing fast, AI-powered medical analysis. It helps turn patient symptoms and medical images into clear, actionable guidance.

In many rural parts of the world, access to specialist doctors is limited. Healthcare workers often have to make tough decisions with basic resources. This project was built to give them a helping hand!

Our AI assistant acts like a smart medical reference. By describing a patient's symptoms and uploading relevant photos (like a skin rash or a wound), a healthcare worker can get:

An assessment of the risk level.

A list of possible medical conditions.

Treatment recommendations that are possible in a low-resource clinic.

Clear advice on whether the patient needs to be referred to a hospital.

🚀 Key Features
